Maxwell is at its heart a mathematical illustration tool.
You can use the Python library to render animations and draw
precise figures. Use the application as a whiteboard, drawing
tool, and visualization client.

At the moment, Maxwell is still far from stable. Breaking
changes may occur without notice. If you would like to run
Maxwell on your system, install the Python dependencies
and compile the Electron app.

Since this project is far from being ready for release,
I have yet to document it properly.
