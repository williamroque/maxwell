Maxwell is at its heart a mathematical illustration tool. You can use the
Python library to render animations and draw precise figures. Use the
application as a whiteboard, drawing tool, and visualization client.

At the moment, Maxwell is still far from stable. Breaking changes may occur
without notice. If you would like to run Maxwell on your system, install
the Python dependencies and compile the Electron app.

Since this project is far from being ready for release, I have yet to
document it properly.
